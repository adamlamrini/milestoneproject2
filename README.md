# Simon game 

Simon is a game of memory skill  , The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence
The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device.
A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons,  
as the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

# UX

My primary target audience is the people interested in playing the game and improving their memory skills .

# Testing

I have tested this website using diffent methods to make sure it works properly and give the user the best experience. Moreover, I used websites such as "www.responsinator.com" to make sure that it works perfectly on different screen sizes.

To make sure that the game works correctly and is responsive to the player's input I had some friends and family try it , and I got a positive response from them.

# Deployment 

1- After successfully pushing the files to github , the deployment starts.

2- Changed the branch name to Master branch from page section in settings.

3- A link was operated and that was my Website.

Deployment: is making the website live and ready to use by the users.

Development: is using Git commands to upload the files that were used in the process of making of the website to GitHub in order to be downloaded/cloned and viewed by the assesor for them to be checked.

To run my code locally, and ensure that it perfectly works, the user should download the source files used along with the HTML code and run it on their device.
